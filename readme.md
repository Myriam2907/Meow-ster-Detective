# üê± Meow-ster Detective ‚Äì Real-time Cat Face Recognition

A real-time cat face recognition app using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, trained on a small custom dataset of my cats‚Äô photos. The project demonstrates computer vision, real-time ML deployment, and data augmentation strategies.

---

## Features

- Detects cat faces in real-time using OpenCV Haar cascades.  
- Classifies known cats with confidence scores and top-3 predictions.  
- Triggers a **‚Äúüö® DANGER! Suspicious cat detected!‚Äù** alert for unknown cats.  
- Smooth predictions to avoid flickering.  
- Supports experimentation with different **data augmentation techniques**.

source meow/bin/activate
--- 

## 2. Install Dependencies
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy streamlit scipy matplotlib scikit-learn

## 3. Train the Model
python train.py

## 4. Run Real-time Recognition App 
python main.py

#OR#

#Streamlit GUI version:
streamlit run app.py

-->Press q to quit the OpenCV webcam app

## 5. Compare Data Augmentation Techniques
python compare_train.py

###DEMO

## üìä Data Augmentation Comparison

Here are visual comparisons of different data augmentation techniques applied during training:

## üê± Real-time Cat Recognition ‚Äì Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the cat recognition app in action:

**Webcam Detection Example:**  
![1st known cat](screenshots/yuki.JPG)
![2nd known cat](screenshots/deniz.JPG)
![3rd known cat](screenshots/snow.JPG)
![unknown cat](screenshots/danger.JPG)
![two cats](screenshots/two.jpg)
‚û°Ô∏è Even though the two cats look very similar (same fur color, same eye color), the model successfully distinguishes between them.

üò∫ Note: The fourth known cat, Caramel, isn‚Äôt shown in the demo because he was sleeping during recording.
